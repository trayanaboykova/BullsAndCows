# 🐂🐄 Bulls and Cows Game

This console-based **Bulls and Cows** game is a classic code-breaking challenge built in Java.  
Developed as part of my Hyperskill learning path, it focuses on logic, loops, and user input handling while providing an interactive and fun guessing experience.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
The game progresses through multiple stages, gradually adding complexity:

- **Secret Code Generation** – The program generates a secret sequence of digits/symbols.  
- **Input Validation** – Ensures player guesses meet length and uniqueness rules.  
- **Grading System** – After each guess, the program reports the number of **bulls** (right symbol, right place) and **cows** (right symbol, wrong place).  
- **Game Loop** – Continues until the player successfully guesses the secret code.  
- **Symbol Variety** – Supports both numbers and letters as valid symbols.

## 🎯 What I Learned
- 🔢 **Algorithm Design**: Implemented logic for bulls/cows calculation.  
- 🔄 **Control Flow**: Used loops and conditionals to manage repeated guessing.  
- 🧑‍💻 **User Interaction**: Validated and processed console input safely.  
- 📐 **Problem Decomposition**: Broke down tasks into manageable methods for clarity and reuse.  
- 🎲 **Randomization**: Applied Java utilities to generate secure and non-repeating secret codes.

## 🔧 Features
- ✅ Custom code length – Define how many symbols the secret code should have.  
- ✅ Flexible symbol range – Choose between digits only or digits + letters.  
- ✅ Real-time feedback – Get bulls and cows after every guess.  
- ✅ Win condition – Game ends once the full secret code is guessed.  
- ✅ Error handling – Handles invalid inputs gracefully.  
- ✅ CLI gameplay – Simple text-based interface, no setup required.

## 🤔 How to Run
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trayanaboykova/BullsAndCows.git
2. Open the project in your Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Compile and run Main.java.
4. Follow the prompts to set code length and symbol range, then start guessing!

## 📈 Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, I:

Strengthened my ability to design algorithms for comparison problems.

Improved input validation and error handling skills.

Gained hands-on experience with loops, arrays, and string processing.

Learned how to balance program structure between readability and functionality.
